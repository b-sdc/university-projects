# Temple University Crime and Budget Analysis 2021

This repo contains the code that supports the following research:

In this project, we explored initiatives that have an effect on crime around the University through the University's campus safety budget. We analyzed crime incident counts over 35 months with their respective yearly budgets using [open data](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/crime-incidents/) provided by the Philadelphia Police Department. Crime incidents are narrowed down to fraud, narcotic/drug violation, theft, and vandalism/criminal mischief in Police District 22, which includes the Temple University Main Campus and areas where many off-campus students reside.
